</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> discourses which I have the
privilege of delivering in this chapel, are specially addressed
to my younger brethren, the undergraduates.&nbsp; I cannot but
dwell with pleasure upon the time when I was myself a student in
this college.&nbsp; This, together with the fact that I am a
native of the lower part of this county, and was brought up among
some of the most primitive of the Welsh people, and consequently
am familiar with their leading sentiments, manners, and customs,
places me, I cannot help feeling, in a state of close sympathy
with the greater number of you.&nbsp; Assuming the existence of
this fellow feeling, I have chosen, on this occasion, to
investigate the social and religious condition of my countrymen
in a light which has not yet penetrated into the fastnesses of
the popular mind of Wales.&nbsp; I have done this, because the
subject is one that elicits ideas of high import, which it is
desirable you should know, inasmuch as they ought to prove of
signal service to you in your future ministrations.</p>
<p>We are living, you should be aware, in critical times.&nbsp;
Old institutions and dogmas are rudely assailed, and challenged
to vindicate their right to respect before the tribunal of
reason.&nbsp; It is <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>well then that you should have some leading ideas
implanted in your mind, so that you may the better be able to
comprehend the nature of the change that is coming over us.&nbsp;
As this change proceeds, you will probably hear cries of despair
from this party and from that, and harsh and uncharitable
accusations will be flung by one at the other.&nbsp; Be not
therefore in perplexity, but of this be very certain, &ldquo;The
Lord hath prepared His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom
ruleth over all;&rdquo; and though we may see the pet schemes of
men ending in signal failure, not for one moment can we suppose
that God&rsquo;s eternal purposes will come to nought, that His
word will return to Him void.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; remarks the learned bishop of this
diocese, &ldquo;is an age of restless curiosity, and searching
inquiry.&nbsp; If we fail to come at the truth, it is not because
we ever shrink from approaching it; not because we let ourselves
be stopped by any conventional barriers of usage or
authority.&nbsp; We admit no right in any one to judge for us on
subjects which we are able to judge for ourselves.&nbsp; We take
no opinion upon trust, because it has come down to us with the
stamp of an honoured name.&nbsp; We adopt it only after we have
made it our own by a rigid scrutiny of its intrinsic claims to
our assent.&nbsp; It is an age in which all pretensions to
respect and deference are jealously examined, and in which it is
more difficult than ever for any false pretences long to elude
detection.&rdquo; <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a></p>
<p>The tendency here described by the bishop, ought to suggest to
you the necessity of making yourselves acquainted with the
leading characteristics of the time, and urge you so to train
your understanding, that you shall be always ready, as the
apostle enjoins, to give a reason for the hope that is in
you.&nbsp; In Wales, however, owing to her isolated condition,
divided like a Milford Haven from the vast Atlantic, it is quite
possible that it may be a considerable time before this restless
and inquiring spirit will make itself so generally felt as
elsewhere.&nbsp; This may be an advantage to you; for, from your
tranquil haven, you may be able <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>dispassionately to form a judicial
opinion of the commotion which is being felt by others at a
distance from you.</p>
<p>Few things indicate more clearly the religious condition of
the Welsh people than the closeness with which, in so many
respects, they apply, but in a certain limited sense, the
principle contained in the text, &ldquo;But one thing is
needful;&rdquo; namely, to learn and to have the mind of Christ,
a requirement far more comprehensive than many seem to think; for
does not that good part which shall not be taken away, embrace
all the knowledge we can obtain of God&rsquo;s power, wisdom, and
love?</p>
<p>How deeply the cares of life, the &ldquo;what shall we eat, or
what shall we drink, or wherewithal shall we be clothed?&rdquo;
the anxieties of business, the wild fever of speculation and
gambling, the frivolities of a life devoted to the exclusive
pursuit of pleasure and excitement, the arduous strain endured in
climbing giddy heights of fame, glory, and power; how deeply are
all such merely temporal pursuits, even were they innocent,
condemned as vanity of vanities, by that loving reproof of our
Saviour, &ldquo;But one thing is needful.&rdquo;&nbsp; However
unmindful we may be of the fact, eternity surrounds and makes
prisoners of us all; and what is the whole world with all its
pomp, wealth, greatness, and pleasures, viewed in the dimming
light of that eternity?&nbsp; What shall it profit a man if he
gain everything but what is really needful, everything but the
good part, since &ldquo;when he dieth he shall carry nothing
away, his glory shall not descend after him?&rdquo;&nbsp; This
indeed, is a most serious and awful consideration, and no one
possessed of proper feeling, can treat it with levity.&nbsp; The
grave, without respect of persons, confronts us all with its
awe-inspiring illimitable beyond; and we cannot, if we would,
brought up as we have been to possess long-standing associations
on the side of Christian truth, and in harmony with the voice of
conscience and the higher aspirations and presentiments of the
soul, bring ourselves to believe that we shall not reap hereafter
as we have sown here.</p>
<p>How often have the hills and valley of Wales resounded to
stains like these, and long may they do so.&nbsp; But a most
important <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>question to ask is, what is comprised in the one thing
needful?&nbsp; Are science, literature, and art of only temporary
value?&nbsp; In the day of trial will they prove, even when true
and pure, but &ldquo;wood, hay, and stubble,&rdquo; or will they
turn out to be a portion of the &ldquo;gold, silver, and precious
stones&rdquo; which we can carry with us to the better land?</p>
<p>I shall not, I presume, be far from the truth, when I declare
that the Welsh are, on the whole, a God-fearing people; and that
they are somewhat remarkable for the manner in which they put
into practice the principle contained in the text, &ldquo;But one
thing is needful.&rdquo;&nbsp; If we except the various pursuits
by which they gain their livelihood, the Welsh-speaking portion
of my countrymen have few proclivities apart from religion.&nbsp;
Their reading is almost purely religious reading; their music,
psalmody; their social gatherings, for the most part, clerical
meetings, religious camp meetings, and the assembling of Sabbath
schools.&nbsp; Their periodical literature consists almost wholly
of religious magazines.&nbsp; Secular knowledge, secular music,
and well nigh everything approaching to fiction, are by many of
them deemed not only valueless but sinful.&nbsp; <i>Y gwir yn
erbyn y byd</i>, a motto of which the Welsh nation may justly be
proud, expresses the intolerance with which many natives of the
Principality regard everything but what they believe to be
downright sober truth.&nbsp; Is it the one thing needful?&nbsp;
If not, avoid it as mischievous; at all events, &ldquo;do not
spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for
that which profiteth not.&rdquo;&nbsp; That the great mass of my
country-people are remarkable for what many would consider the
logical reduction of Christianity into practice, is
unquestionable; but are they therefore, any more than St. Anthony
and the early pilgrims, who believed they did the same thing, to
be pointed out as worthy the imitation of others in all
respects?</p>
<p>The Welsh-speaking inhabitants of this country, it must be
admitted, live in a manner which has its attractions for
primitiveness and homeliness; their wants are few, their passions
are much under control, they are self-denying, industrious, and
provident; and throughout the Principality, much to its credit,
criminal cases <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>but seldom darken the calendar.&nbsp; Such being the
social condition of the Welsh, but more especially in the
agricultural districts of what has been termed Welsh Wales,
though not indeed without exceptions as regards keeping the
&ldquo;body in temperance, soberness, and chastity,&rdquo; would
it not be desirable to take note of the influences which conduce
to such a state of things, with the view of bringing the same to
bear upon communities, in which so many are deplorably corrupt,
criminal, and profane?&nbsp; When, however, we come to consider
that one of the leading causes of the peculiarities exhibited by
the Welsh, is the isolation resulting from their language, few
distinctive points remain in their social economy which admit of
being copied with advantage by other communities.&nbsp;
Influences which are rapidly changing the character of the
English, and the better educated classes in these parts, exercise
but a faint effect upon the primitive Welsh; because they are, by
their language, shut out from the rest of the world.&nbsp; They
are like the river water, which is out of the main current.&nbsp;
Their manners, customs, and ideas, all tend to permanency.&nbsp;
The sons follow with little change in the steps of their fathers,
and the daughters in those of their mothers.&nbsp; As a
consequence of this, even in business pursuits, they are, like
the French Canadians, deficient in enterprise, and acquire
property mostly by saving and self-denial.&nbsp; Like the
Chinese, they give one the idea of a people whose development has
been arrested at a certain stage, whose inspiration is drawn from
the past, and not, as by the Israelites of old, from the
future.&nbsp; They love to dwell on the antiquity of their
language, and its purity from foreign elements.&nbsp; What they
were is to them a source of fond exultation.&nbsp; What they are
destined to become, they fear to contemplate.</p>
<p>I claim to be a lover of my country.&nbsp; I admire much the
social and civic virtues, and the religious enthusiasm of her
people; but I am forced to admit that among the Welsh, as such,
there is no onward tendency.&nbsp; That is a great and noble
ambition of theirs which urges them to retain their language; and
they firmly believe in the prophecy, &ldquo;<i>Eu hiaith a
gadwant</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to be equally bent on perpetuating
certain peculiarities which unite them with the <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>past as a race
opposed to their English neighbours, this desire to surround
themselves with a sort of Chinese wall, instead of letting
&ldquo;the dead past bury its dead,&rdquo; is not the part of
true patriotism.&nbsp; For, by blindly adhering to such a
stationary policy, they will eventually, as a distinct nation, be
submerged by the tide of progress, instead of floating on its
surface, and exist about as much in reality as their fabled
Lowland Hundred.&nbsp; In everything but political sectarianism,
and this only because they are moved to it by political
agitators, the Welsh are in fact a most conservative nation.</p>
<p>This primitive condition of the Welsh, however, is not
singular.&nbsp; It has existed, and exists even now, in various
parts of the world.&nbsp; As an instance with which we have
lately been made acquainted, it may be mentioned, that Wallace
has found, in some of the islands of the Malay Archipelago,
several communities which have no intercourse with the world at
large, leading an industrious, peaceful, moral life; committing
little or no crime; &ldquo;showing the work of the law written in
their hearts;&rdquo; and a pattern to many of the inhabitants of
so called Christian and civilized countries.&nbsp; When we
contemplate such beautiful simplicity and purity of life, we must
admit that these people &ldquo;are not far from the kingdom of
God;&rdquo; and one is tempted to doubt whether civilization with
its extremes of wealth and destitution, refinement and barbarism,
culture and ignorance, integrity and crime, saintliness and
profanity, is the blessing that it is commonly held to be.&nbsp;
But yet if we compare the endowments of mankind with those of the
more intelligent brutes, we find that man has a capacity for
being educated into a higher being in proportion as the race
stores up knowledge, a power which opens the vast treasury of
nature; whereas the most intelligent of the brutes are but
slightly educable, and therefore stationary.&nbsp; While man,
however, is gifted with this immense superiority, he does not
always turn it to the greatest advantage.&nbsp; Some nations are
rapidly advancing; some, having advanced in time past up to a
certain point, have either long ago halted, or have gone back to
barbarism or worse.&nbsp; Of these three tendencies, the one
strongly manifested by the Welsh is halting.&nbsp; What forces <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>there are
urging them forward are almost entirely from a foreign source;
and the fact that such influences are operating upon them is, by
many of their number, regarded as a misfortune, by few as a
blessing.&nbsp; Painful, however, as it must be to Welsh
patriotism, and high-wrought sentiment, yet it is not to be
doubted that the genius of Wales is receding before that of
England, as is so clearly evident to those who dwell on the
border land, where the two rival powers are brought face to
face.&nbsp; And now what I wish my country-people particularly to
understand is, that as long as they adopt a policy of stagnation,
Cambria is sure to be worsted in the conflict for distinctive
existence; because such is the law of evolution, a law which
pervades all nature; and to this law I would now draw your
attention.</p>
<p>What is called evolution or development in nature is a
procedure from simplicity to complexity of structure.&nbsp; The
more elaborate and special an organ is, the higher is the
function which it has to perform.&nbsp; To select an illustration
from the animal kingdom: among the lowest kind of animals called
the <i>hydra</i> there is no distinction of parts such as seen in
the human body; no nutritive, muscular, and nervous system; no
senses, no brain.&nbsp; Each portion of them being complete in
itself, these animals can be propagated by simply cutting them
into bits.&nbsp; Each part is independent of every other part; as
if in this country we had local government, but no central
government.&nbsp; The whole is a medley in which there is no
division of labour and of responsibility, no interdependence.</p>
<p>How different the case in man&rsquo;s elevated and complex
nature!&nbsp; And how can I express this more forcibly, or in a
way better adapted for conveying to you the principle here held
in view, than in these words of St. Paul:&mdash;&ldquo;There are
many members, yet but one body.&nbsp; And the eye cannot say unto
the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet,
I have no need of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The principle here enunciated
is that of unity in variety.&nbsp; &ldquo;The body is one, and
hath many members; and all the members of the body, though they
be many, are one body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chapter from which these passages are taken demands your
special notice, in order that you may see how fully the
Apostle&rsquo;s <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>mind was possessed with the law of unity in
variety&mdash;many members, yet but one body; and together with
the sequel to it, the New Testament song of love, should deeply
impress upon our hearts the all important truth conveyed in the
words, &ldquo;Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally
members thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; There will be diversities in the
Church, there cannot be uniformity, but there must be
unity.&nbsp; &ldquo;For as it is noted by one of the
fathers,&rdquo; says Bacon, &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s coat, indeed,
had no seam, but the Church&rsquo;s vesture was of divers
colours; whereupon he saith, &lsquo;<i>In veste varietas sit</i>,
<i>scissura non sit</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a time, even in the memory of living men, when Welsh
households had little need of aid from commerce, when almost
every kind of food was home grown, and almost every article of
clothing home spun and home made.&nbsp; Some lament that this is
not still the case.&nbsp; Let these, however, console themselves
with the knowledge that as mankind progress, they are made, by
division of labour, to become more dependent on each other, and
that perforce the law of love, of mutual beneficence, is being
propagated in the world, not only by the Christian ministry, but
by the agency of commercial, scientific, and literary
progress.&nbsp; Not only the inhabitants of the same land, but
the various nations of the earth are more and more coming to
this, that they can less and less do without each other&rsquo;s
co-operation.</p>
<p>An early stage of society, like that of animal development, is
a medley.&nbsp; It is made up of families or tribes, each of
which has its own separate organization; and the tendency is,
where selfishness and a contentious spirit predominate, to split
up into fragments; whereas, on the other hand, where the domestic
virtues are highly advanced, and there is a general disposition
to sink private interest in public good, men will cling together,
thus forming larger communities, exercising more advanced
functions, and eventually absorb those weaker tribes which have
not acquired these virtues; that is, have not realized, to the
same extent, the principle of many members in one body.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the human mind, in its first attempts
to pierce the mists of ignorance and mystery, to embrace, in one
view, <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the
whole realm of knowledge, and necessarily to suppose that it is
much more limited than it is.&nbsp; The astrologers of old little
dreamed that the stars, which were the objects of their
superstitions contemplation, were but a small portion of the
illimitable universe of worlds.&nbsp; We see at first of any
subject which we study but about as much as we see of the stars
without the aid of the telescope, or of minute objects near at
hand without the aid of the microscope.&nbsp; The realm of
knowledge enlarges in proportion as we intimately explore
it.&nbsp; The more we discover distinctions, which have been
overlooked by previous observers, or the more we differentiate,
and at the same time assign the differences their right place in
the class, the unity to which they belong, the more we advance
that branch of investigation towards which our efforts are
turned.&nbsp; In the infancy of knowledge, science, poetry,
history, politics, theology, form one medley, like the hydra in
the animal world.&nbsp; Pythagoras, because he possessed
insufficient powers of abstraction, could not keep mathematics
apart from metaphysics, theology, and &aelig;sthetics.&nbsp; And
Xenophanes must needs, in the philosophical and theological
travail of his soul, give expression to his ideas in flowing
hexameters.&nbsp; The early ballads were not simply the
minstrelsy, but the only chronicles of the period.&nbsp; Out of
the medley state, which has now been described, the sciences file
in the order of their simplicity, generality, and remoteness from
religious, poetic, and political emotion.</p>
<p>The development of knowledge and of civilization, therefore,
like that of the animal kingdom, is commensurate with the degree
in which labour is divided, while perfect unity is
retained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now hath God set the members every one of
them in the body, as it hath pleased Him.&nbsp; And if they were
all one member, where were the body?&rdquo; (where were the
multiplicity in the unity?)&nbsp; &ldquo;But now are they many
members, yet but one body.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a striking instance of
the manner in which civilization is effected by this law Guizot
tells us that it is more advanced in modern than in ancient
times, because it is more complex.&nbsp; In ancient civilization,
there was no country population existing as a class distinct from
that of the towns, and exercising a power peculiar to
itself.&nbsp; By means <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>of the feudal system, however, the
country population has assumed a distinct character in modern
times, and it wields an influence which greatly modifies the
power of the great populous centres.&nbsp; Here we have another
instance of differentiation out of a prior medley state, such as
existed in the civilization of Greece and of Rome.</p>
<p>So much chiefly for the doctrine of differentiation; now more
particularly for that of unity.&nbsp; Let us never forget that
God has fashioned the body in such a perfect manner that there
should be no schism among the different members, but that there
should be &ldquo;the same care one for another.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus
it is found to be throughout the region of animal life.&nbsp;
There is, at first, no variety in the unity.&nbsp; As animals
ascend in the scale of being, variety emerges; organs having
special functions to perform are divided off from the
structureless germinal matter; but the oneness of the living
being is perfectly preserved; there is no schism among the
various parts of the body to which a special sphere of labour is
allotted.&nbsp; Now this is just what <i>ought</i> to be the case
with the great social body.&nbsp; If it advances from one stage
to a higher, it must be by division of labour combined with the
union of love.&nbsp; It is by division of labour that men acquire
that skill and excellence in the arts, that greater accuracy and
extent of knowledge in general which enables them to surpass
their forefathers.&nbsp; But here we enter the sphere of will and
of moral obligation, choice, and duty; and instead of witnessing
that harmonious action of many parts exhibited by the involuntary
regions of organic life, we witness all those evils which, if
they do not have the effect of awakening a nation to the error of
its ways, eventually lead to anarchy and decay.&nbsp; What,
however, we mostly behold in civilized communities is, that while
some are in a highly advanced state, the majority form an
appalling mediocrity, while too many are but paupers and
criminals.&nbsp; Yea, the social body is seen to have many weak,
many diseased parts; and is often, through strife and dissension,
threatened with dismemberment.&nbsp; These are the great trials
which civilization has to encounter; and amidst great physical
progress, notably amidst <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and wealthy magnificence, there may
be much rottenness at the base.</p>
<p>Since communities as they advance become more divided into
members having special offices to perform, there is, where the
higher emotions, the source of union, are not in the ascendant, a
tendency to an isolation of the parts, to one-sidedness, to a
want of &ldquo;the same care one for another,&rdquo; to those
gross inequalities, those frightful extremes which too often
reflect such discredit upon our large towns and cities; social
disorders which it is the province of the Church to counteract,
laying a heavy weight of responsibility upon her, as well as upon
the State; and which are found to exist to a far less extent
among a Christian and primitive people like the Welsh.</p>
<p>The lower animals exhibit a well-regulated constitution.&nbsp;
They fulfil the purpose of their being; there is no schism among
their members.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we saw the lion,&rdquo; says
George Combe, &ldquo;one day tearing in pieces every animal that
crossed his path, and then oppressed with remorse for the death
of his victims, or compassionately healing those whom he had
mangled, we should exclaim, what an inconsistent creature, and
conclude that he could not by any possibility be happy, on
account of this opposition between, the principles of his
nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this is just the opposition which
deforms human nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;The flesh lusteth against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary
the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye
would.&rdquo;&nbsp; How is this internal discord to be quelled
but by the inner man having the mastery over the inferior
propensities of our nature?&nbsp; As long as these latter are not
brought under the wholesome restraints of the Gospel, the
Master&rsquo;s easy yoke, the truth which makes us free from
carnal bondage; as long as the raging waves of animal passion
hear not the voice of Him who says, &ldquo;Peace, be
still,&rdquo; in vain shall we look for those social and
political virtues which constitute the stability of a state; and
which, therefore, since self-preservation is the first law of
nature, it should be a prime duty of the State to promote.&nbsp;
Without vital Christianity, without a large number on the side of
God, and forming the salt <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of the earth, we must expect nothing
but general corruption and downfall.&nbsp; We may pride ourselves
upon our railways, our steam navigation, our electric telegraphs,
and all the rest of our mechanical wonders; we may pride
ourselves upon our immense resources, our domestic comforts, our
scientific and literary attainments, our proficiency in the fine
arts; but if the conscience of the nation be not adequately
developed by a devout and enlightened contemplation of
God&rsquo;s holy will, the social body will be constantly
reminding us, by its feverish restlessness and by its terrible
sores, that it is not nicely compacted together&mdash;that
&ldquo;where one member suffers, all the members do not suffer
with it,&rdquo; that we have not paid sufficient heed to
&ldquo;the one thing needful;&rdquo; and that we are, in
consequence, reaping, by way of warning, disquieting and painful
intimations that though our progress is rapid, the rails on which
we run are alarmingly insecure.</p>
<p>Now among the Welsh people the elements of stability, of
unity, are strong, but those of progress or differentiation are
weak.&nbsp; Then as regards the people&rsquo;s social condition
in general, it exhibits few of those disheartening extremes which
are so often to be met with in our large towns, but presents,
with slight deviations, a general level of moderate
elevation.</p>
<p>In more civilized communities, and notably in one of them,
while the elements of physical and intellectual advancement are
in a state of vigorous existence, social virtue and political
stability are in a very unsatisfactory condition indeed.&nbsp;
There are many members, but they have not arrived at that stage
of perfection in which they constitute one body.&nbsp; Let us
hope, however, that as <i>chaos</i> preceded <i>cosmos</i>, so it
will be with them.&nbsp; Then as respects the various stages of
development which exist side by side, they present all the
inequalities of a mountain region&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A savage horde amid the civilized;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A servile band among the lordly free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now these two requirements, variety and unity, when you go
hence to proclaim the Gospel, it will be most important that you
should promote.&nbsp; The &ldquo;unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace&rdquo; <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>will, doubtless, be to you a prime object of
cultivation.&nbsp; But will you not also exert yourselves to
kindle in the bosom of your country-people that spirit of
progress which results from always adding new truths to those of
the past; and from continually realizing more and more the truth,
beauty, purity, and grandeur of the indwelling Word of God,
namely, &ldquo;His Word abiding in you,&rdquo; that is, in the
children of light, the only medium through which revelation, as
distinguished from the mere outward signs which alone can exist
in the Book, is kept, by the Holy Spirit, a living saving power
on earth.</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> world is moving on; the
nation which stands still must be left behind.&nbsp; No people
can now live upon its remembrances.&nbsp; Like the runners in the
ancient games, the nation which surrenders its torch to another,
not only loses the race, but loses the light.&nbsp; The whole
distinction of English intellect has arisen from its continually
looking forward, forgetting the past, and continually
anticipating a new day of toils and of triumphs, of severer
straggles, but of loftier splendours.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
distinction here pointed out by Dr. Croly, in an essay entitled,
&ldquo;The Cultivation of the Intellect, a Divine Duty of
Man,&rdquo; does not exist to any extent among the great body of
the Welsh people, many of whom attach but slight importance to
the acquisition of knowledge; because, possessing but little of
it themselves, they are naturally disposed to regard it as a
matter of mere temporary concern.&nbsp; Even the majority of
their religious teachers having, till of late years, no knowledge
of any books but the Welsh and the English versions of the Bible,
Matthew Henry&rsquo;s <i>Commentary</i>, and not many more,
tacitly, if not openly, encouraged this tendency.&nbsp; For
uninformed minds are prone to disparage intellectual attainments,
and to interpret the Holy Scriptures, so as to find therein
abundant confirmation of their primitive conceptions.&nbsp; Yes,
even in our own Church, which did make some pretensions to
learning, was to be found, not fifty years ago, too many a parish
priest without a library, too many a Trulliber forgetful of the
high responsibility of his sacred calling.</p>
<p>But is familiarity with aught but the Bible&mdash;with
philosophy, science, history, and &aelig;sthetics&mdash;even
remotely comprised in the good part which shall not be taken away
from us when we go hence for ever?&nbsp; Yea, is not such
knowledge &ldquo;the wisdom of the world, <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>which is
foolishness with God?&rdquo; and is it not written that
&ldquo;not many wise after the flesh are called?&rdquo;&nbsp;
These questions, I am strongly impressed, indicate the tone of
too much of the preaching in Wales.&nbsp; But we need not
hesitate to reply that, though the knowledge of evil and of
science falsely so called is to be avoided as most pernicious to
the soul, the knowledge of good, in all its bearings, cannot be
too diligently sought.&nbsp; He who knows nothing but the Bible,
as Matthew Arnold reminds us, knows but little of the
Bible.&nbsp; Indeed the knowledge of good, yea, and taken in the
widest sense, cannot be thought of slight value and of transient
importance, without irreverence towards Him of whose existence,
intelligence, power, and goodness, it is the great exponent.</p>
<p>That the passion of acquiring a knowledge of God&rsquo;s works
and ways in general was strong in Solomon, we cannot doubt.&nbsp;
He, indeed, tells us that in the exclusive pursuit of
intellectual truth there is no real satisfaction to be gained,
&ldquo;that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the
sun . . . yea, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he
not be able to find it.&rdquo;&nbsp; All passionate seekers after
undiscovered truth know that much mental toil, and probably years
of wearisome watching, are demanded before any one can hope to
snatch a new secret from the close keeping of the unknown.&nbsp;
This must be humiliating to the man of sanguine temperament, but
profitably so, because it cultivates within him a longing for the
happy time when &ldquo;we shall know as also we are
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then intellectual attainments, though calculated to satisfy
the wants of the perceptive and reasoning faculties, cannot still
the cravings of the conscience, cannot meet the demands of the
moral and religious emotions.&nbsp; These can find in such food
only a stone when hungering for bread, the apple fair to the eye,
but ashes under the teeth.&nbsp; When Solomon, therefore, sought
for full satisfaction of soul in the exercise of his intellect,
and the acquisition of its related knowledge, meanwhile starving
his moral and religious nature, it was only to be expected that
such a course should be found to lead to &ldquo;vanity and
vexation of spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while admitting to the full the humiliating limitations of
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the mind
which Solomon deplores, and that the soul cannot live by
intellectual food only, even though it be contained in
God&rsquo;s own Word, yet we fully believe that it is man&rsquo;s
duty, as well as his privilege, to seek for truth wherever to be
found; and that he can so cultivate his intellect, and store his
memory, as to ensure thereby a greater nearness of soul to his
Father in heaven.</p>
<p>The operations of the giant-intellect, we know, are not
acceptable to God, except they are imbued with that glow of soul
which constitutes the babe-like spirit.&nbsp; But how can the
giant-intellect, when thus wedded to the love of holiness, better
serve God than by ever realizing more and more of His divine
fulness as displayed in all his works and ways?</p>
<p>Although we must allow that no one is so low in the scale of
intellectual culture as to be out of the reach of that redemption
which is not conceded to learning and talent, but to newness of
heart, still we must not forget that the apostle says,
&ldquo;Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in
malice be ye children; but in understanding be men.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Let the mental horizon of genius, joined to deepest piety,
stretch ever so far away, it encircles but an insignificant
portion of that which is open to the glance of Omniscience.&nbsp;
Under the most favourable circumstances, the human mind, while in
this present tabernacle, must meet with many problems which it
&ldquo;cannot know now, but shall know hereafter.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And now what we would with much stress insist upon is, in
opposition to an opinion too prevalent in this part of the
kingdom, that the believer who has a mind of little grasp,
scantily stored with information, has not the same command of
spiritual blessings, does not live so fully the Christian life,
does not mount in heart and mind so near to the Redeemer&rsquo;s
throne in heaven, as the believer whose mind has attained a high
degree of culture, and amassed large stores of knowledge.&nbsp;
It must be so, for the region of divine truth being boundless, he
who is ever pushing further into it, and ever striving to embody
its purity into his life and practice, must be further advanced
than the man who simply loiters near some one spot in this
region, as soon as he has gained admittance into it.&nbsp; And
now is it competent for the loiterer, say <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>for the man
of one talent and little energy, to say to the more gifted and
diligent inquirer, &ldquo;Your labour is in vain; but one thing
is needful; and that is simply to pass over the
border&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Is this view, so disheartening to the Christian scholar, in
accordance with the teaching of the Word of God?&nbsp; What does
the most learned of the apostles tell us in regard to his own
experience?&nbsp; &ldquo;Brethren, I count not myself to have
apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which
are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are
before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling
in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this is exactly true to the
experience, not only of the Christian yearning for perfect
freedom from sin, and a feeling of complete incorporation with
Christ, but of every one who longs to surpass his past
achievements, from Alexander pining for more worlds to conquer,
down to the miser who the richer he becomes the poorer he
feels.&nbsp; Thus the great poet, artist, or musician, is never
quite satisfied with his accomplished works, but always feels how
much better they might be, his ever growing fastidiousness urging
him to cry out, <i>Excelsior</i>, <i>excelsior</i>!&nbsp; Highly
cultivated minds, more especially if of an imaginative turn, are
never satisfied with the real.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ideal, the
ideal,&rdquo; is their cry.&nbsp; They push on to lay hold of it,
but it ever recedes before them.&nbsp; The ideal will always
shine far in advance of the real.</p>
<p>This longing for the unattained, when sanctified by the Spirit
of God, will never permit the on-pressing Christian to feel that
he has finally, and without occasion for further effort, laid
hold of the one thing needful.&nbsp; Yea, in the life to come the
same feeling will exist, for after ages of looking into the
wonders of God&rsquo;s love, wisdom, and power, the language of
the heart still will be, &ldquo;I count not myself to have laid
hold of the divine ideal.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is recorded by those who have sought the conversion of the
savage that his capacity for receiving Christian truth is
commentate only with the contracted character of his intellect,
and the low range of his attainments.&nbsp; If he does become a
Christian, it is only such views of the Gospel find an abode in
his heart as <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>accord with the feeble mental powers which he
possesses.&nbsp; And now I would ask, is this degree of truth all
that is absolutely necessary for salvation in <i>every</i>
ease?&nbsp; Being but a child in intellect, the savage is not yet
capable of putting away childish things.&nbsp; But you may think
he can be educated, and be thus brought into a state of mind in
which the seed of the Word may grow with less stint.&nbsp; But
then it is found that his capacity for education, except in rare
instances indeed, is very slight.&nbsp; So again I ask, after an
attempt has been made to enlarge his mind, is that measure of
Christianity which he is capable of realizing all that is
absolutely necessary in every case?&nbsp; I take it for granted
that your answer to this question is in the negative.&nbsp; Do
you not believe that besides the education of individuals, there
is, as the result of this, the education of the race; that as the
sins of the fathers descend unto the third and fourth generation
of them who continue to hate God, the punishment for violation of
law increasing in intensity till the guilty race dies out; so
God&rsquo;s mercies in the shape of increasing aptitude for
knowledge, refinement, and Christian elevation, are transmitted
from generation to generation among those who stedfastly love the
Lord?&nbsp; At all events, savage tribes when brought under the
influence of civilized nations, instead of becoming civilized
themselves, disappear from off the face of the earth.&nbsp; For
as the wind which makes the larger flame burn more brightly,
extinguishes the lesser and feebler flame, so the manners and
customs of advanced life put upon savage nature a strain too
heavy to be borne; and this because such a nature needs to
undergo that gradual elevation of the race which it would take
generations to accomplish.</p>
<p>What is the drift of these remarks?&nbsp; That the more the
mind is developed, both intellectually and emotionally, the
greater becomes its power of realizing the knowledge of good, and
therefore of glorifying God&mdash;the Good.</p>
<p>When a gifted man stores his mind with truth, and at the same
time strives his utmost to attain purity of heart, his Christian
experience must needs be widened, and his whole soul elevated, in
proportion to the number of distinct kinds of truth which combine
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>with each
other, and with the ruling passion of his life, to form one grand
result, many systems of truth all threaded on that one cord,
&ldquo;the love of Christ constraining;&rdquo; much
differentiation, but perfect unity; many members, yet but one
body; in short, a state of mind similar in kind to the Son of
Man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For is there anything in the whole range of
the sciences, physical, biological, political, social, and moral;
anything connected with the theory and the practice of art;
anything relating to the history of the past, even eternity <i>ab
ante</i>; in short, is there anything which is <i>not</i>
perfectly open to the mind of Jesus?&nbsp; And is He not our
elder <i>Brother</i>, <i>and divine</i> Pattern in all things
heavenly?&nbsp; Is not the realization, in so far as that
privilege is extended to us of His mind, to be the grand object
of our life here and for evermore?</p>
<p>To be possessed of talents and of facilities for obtaining for
them the highest cultivation, what do these gifts involve?&nbsp;
That they should be diligently used in promoting the glory of God
who gave them.&nbsp; Can the savage mind know much of God?&nbsp;
Can he who knows no more of the infinite ocean of truth than he
has explored of it, so to speak, in his rude canoe, know as much
as is really essential for you and for me of the redeeming love
of Christ?&nbsp; The true answer to this question evidently is,
that in a babe&rsquo;s mind you can expect no more to exist than
a babe&rsquo;s knowledge; it has &ldquo;need of milk, and not of
strong meat;&rdquo; but &ldquo;unto whomsoever much is given, of
him shall much be required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Christian life then is not a fixed quantity, the same in
the child, the savage, the barbarian, and the Welsh peasant, as
in the saintly scholars of the Christian Church; but answering to
every advance in pure knowledge, there is, in the man after
God&rsquo;s own heart, a corresponding advance in moral and
spiritual excellence.&nbsp; For emotions are manifested only in
proportion as ideas form the branches round which emotions
twine.&nbsp; No well-defined emotion can exist without its
related ideas.&nbsp; True, ideas are countless, while emotions
are comparatively few, and from age to age retain their identity
and freshness, while ideas change and change.&nbsp; Still,
however, emotion must enter into union with ideas in order to <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>have any
definite existence.&nbsp; The more, therefore, the intellect is
stored with knowledge, the greater also must be the number of
instances in which ideas and sentiments become associated
together.</p>
<p>But what is of more importance still to consider is, that
certain ideas can only exist when other ideas have been fully
realized first.&nbsp; The former grow out of the latter as branch
from trunk, and twig from branch.&nbsp; Certain twinings of
feeling with thought must follow, therefore, the evolution of
these various grades of ideas.&nbsp; Now the notions in the
savage mind are of the lowest grade, and rest assured that his
religious feelings, however warmly manifested, cannot reach
beyond the level of his knowledge.</p>
<p>Now it must be almost superfluous to ask the question which
these remarks suggest.&nbsp; Are all the thoughts and feelings
which hold a higher elevation than the lowest, to be deemed, not
as the necessaries, but the luxuries of religion?&nbsp; You
cannot fail to perceive that the reply to this inquiry must
depend on the level you have been made to occupy.&nbsp; If you
have been placed in a high position to start from, and if every
advantage in the way of mental culture has been extended to you,
the one thing needful for you is clearly to push on higher, to
enlarge the intellect by searching still further for the true,
which to the heart is the good and the beautiful; and to enlarge
the heart by cultivating for these latter, an evergrowing
love.&nbsp; Moreover, are you not justified in believing, that if
you do this, you will be choosing that good part which shall not
be taken away from you when you die?&nbsp; For if we are not to
forget in heaven that we were once on earth; if we are not to
lose the feeling of identity which is to unite our heavenly with
our earthly existence, why should it be thought incredible that
the knowledge of good which we acquire below should not be one of
the links in that chain of identity; more especially as it will
be our supreme delight to be always extending such knowledge in
the realms of light?&nbsp; Yea, what a source of joy it will be
in the bright spirit-land to discover that our mental powers are
as compared with their prior state, so much enlarged and
strengthened, that we can acquire knowledge with so much more
ease and precision <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>than while on earth, and that questions which baffled
solution then, are easily solved now.&nbsp; But does not this
imply that the remembrance of the earthly life, with its trials,
miseries, infirmities, ignorances, and doubts, is the dark
surface, which by contrast, heightens the splendour of celestial
bliss?</p>
<p>Even in heaven, then, knowledge will be progressively
acquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; writes Dr. M&lsquo;Leod,
&ldquo;surely imagines, that on entering heaven, we can at once
obtain perfect knowledge; perfect, I mean, not in the sense of
accuracy, but of fully possessing all that can be known.&nbsp;
This is possible for Deity only.&nbsp; For it may be asserted
with confidence that Gabriel knows more to-day than he knew
yesterday.&rdquo; <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a></p>
<p>Throughout these remarks, it has been supposed that the
scholar&rsquo;s piety is great; for without piety, however
extensive his learning, he will have less insight into divine
truth than the dullest of God&rsquo;s own scholars.&nbsp; Truth
also impels us to concede that the good qualities of the heart,
and intellectual capacity, are frequently bestowed in an inverse
proportion upon God&rsquo;s people; so that many that are first
in the one, shall be last in the other, and the last in this
shall be first in that.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have now, to the best of my endeavour, combated a too
prevalent propensity, not only of my countrymen, but of most
people of little or no education; a sort of complacent resting in
ignorance, as if it were the part of a wise man, and most in
accordance with the teaching of Holy Scripture, whereas it is, in
fact, but the self-excusing Stoicism of the unfledged mind.</p>
<p>But surely since man is endowed with capacities for
advancement in knowledge and righteousness, we must conclude that
they are bestowed upon him with the intention that he should use
them to the greatest advantage.&nbsp; In proof of this
conclusion, we find that the nation which does not highly esteem
these gifts must be content to give place to one that does; must,
indeed, decay, while the other goes on from strength to
strength.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>And now
to apply these remarks more closely to you, my younger brethren,
what does your presence in this college imply?&nbsp; That in the
estimation of the wisest and best men of our communion, an
ignorant ministry is an evil to be avoided, as not only
discreditable and injurious to our Church, but dishonouring to
Him who gives us talents in order that they may be made the very
most of in promoting His glory and His cause.</p>
<p>Ponder well over the fact, that without knowledge it will be
impossible for you to raise yourselves to a high level.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The barbarian,&rdquo; remarks Dr. Croly, &ldquo;cannot
bring the past in aid of the present, cannot ascend a step in
civilization on the stone laid by the generation gone; he has
virtually no ancestors, and can have no posterity.&nbsp; The red
man of the West is, at this moment, the same solitary, fierce,
and miserable being that he was a thousand years ago.&nbsp; The
Mongol is the same wild, marauding, and miserable being as when
he followed the trumpets of Tamerlane.&rdquo; <a
name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; Now, what is the reason that
these people do not advance?&nbsp; It is because they do not
begin building the fabric of sound knowledge.&nbsp; And do you
not perceive that the same deficiency which keeps them down as a
nation, will also keep you down as individuals?&nbsp; If, among
these people, one generation laid the foundation, and another and
another continually built thereon, they would rise in proportion
in civilization and power.&nbsp; The scholar of to-day,
therefore, owes his high position to the accumulations of the
giant-intellects of the past.&nbsp; &ldquo;Other men laboured,
and ye are entered into their labours.&rdquo;&nbsp; The modern
scholar by moderate effort, though no giant, stands upon an
elevation which was piled up by one generation of learners and
thinkers after another with slow, painstaking, and disinterested
toil.&nbsp; This rich heritage of knowledge, this grand moral
leverage, this high energy of position, constituting the
imperative reason for not &ldquo;breaking with the
past&rdquo;&mdash;of which the present is the outcome&mdash;it
should be your holy ambition to attain.&nbsp; For how can you
stretch out a hand to pull others up, unless you occupy higher
ground than <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>they?&nbsp; Bear with me then while I tell you that
unless you thus strive to fit yourselves for the onerous duties
of the sacred calling which you hope to adopt, you will be doing
nothing towards averting the downfall of Welsh nationality.&nbsp;
Of course, you will meet with too many who will tell you that the
only way to do this is to encourage the present fatal tendency of
Cambria to live solely on her remembrances.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
however, the invincible army of progress, with the tramp of doom
to effete nationalities, marches steadily and irresistibly on;
and the Welsh, as a distinct race, if not better led and advised,
will, by the deadly error of seeking &ldquo;the living among the
dead,&rdquo; simply become a people of the past.</p>
<p>It is my regard for my country that forces me to say what I
do.&nbsp; I hope she will always retain a certain degree of
individuality, and live to emulate in <i>her own Welsh way</i>
the other great nations of the kingdom.&nbsp; The Scotch do this,
why should not we?&nbsp; Honesty, however, forces me to affirm
that by clinging unwisely to her antiquated habits when she ought
to have out-grown them, Cambria will be thrown down, the
advancing host will march over her prostrate form, and she will
cease to be a living presence on the earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
strife of tribes, of races, and of nations, in the political as
in the physical world,&rdquo; says the author of <i>Habit and
Intelligence</i>, &ldquo;a process of natural selection goes on,
of which the tendency is to give the victory to the best.&rdquo;
<a name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a"
class="citation">[25a]</a>&nbsp; And Bishop Butler <a
name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a> foreshadowed the same law when he
indicated that as power and reason united have proved themselves
capable of prevailing over power devoid of reason, as exhibited
by the brute creation; so there is in society a tendency in power
combined with reason and virtue, to overcome opposing power
combined with reason and vice; and God be thanked that it is so,
namely, that of the righteous it can be said, &ldquo;Greater is
He that is in you than he that is in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
now let me remind you that in such a combination as power,
reason, and virtue, one very generally <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>existing among the people of Wales,
there are several degrees of development, and that the higher
degree, the more fully differentiated, that which contains most
members in one body, will, when brought into competition with it,
always, in the course of time bear down or absorb the lower.</p>
<p>As standard-bearers in the army of the great Captain, it will
be your duty, therefore, both to God and your own people, while
encouraging among the latter that state of firm formation which
already is so characteristic of them, to be urgent also in
calling upon them to follow you, as bravely you lead the way
onward, upward, God-ward.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Considerable stress has been laid in this discourse upon that
element of the law of unity and variety&mdash;division of
labour.&nbsp; Now, in concluding, I would beg to guard you
against a misconception on this point which may prove mischievous
to you.&nbsp; In my college days, it used to be a subject of
complaint with many of the men, that they should have to spend so
much of their time in studies, which, as they thought, had no
direct connexion with theological training; that is, they were
earnest advocates for greater division of labour.&nbsp; I have no
doubt there are many of a similar way of thinking among you
now.&nbsp; But are you not aware that those who have climbed to a
higher elevation than the one you have yet been able to reach,
see clearly that all these studies are really necessary to make
of you ordinary scholars, gentlemen, and competent parish
priests?</p>
<p>Archbishop Whately, in early youth, threatened to become a
calculating prodigy; and you may have read that many an
intellectual prodigy has been imbecile in every direction but the
one in which excellence was manifested.&nbsp; Well,
Whately&rsquo;s parents, instead of being gratified at their
son&rsquo;s passion for numbers, very wisely took alarm.&nbsp;
They sought competent advice, and means were taken to prevent his
mind taking an abnormal development in one direction, at the
expense of its efficiency in others.&nbsp; The result very
probably was, that we lost another Colburn or Bidder, but gained
an Archbishop Whately.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>The
conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing account is
evident.&nbsp; It is your duty, if you would be well informed,
average scholars and thinkers, to acquire more kinds of knowledge
than one, and thereby to cultivate all the intellectual faculties
of your mind; remembering that the greater the variety which the
unity contains, the higher is its position in the scale of
created being.&nbsp; Up to a certain point, therefore, we must
all try to be universal scholars.&nbsp; After this point has been
reached, what makes division of labour necessary is the vast
extent to which knowledge has now attained, making it impossible
for universal scholars like Leibnitz and the admirable Crichton
to exist in these days; to which we must add the limitations, and
the variety of bent existing in the mind of men, not forgetting
the shortness of time.&nbsp; But then what individuals fail to
accomplish the race can; and we have to consider, in the
perfection of unselfishness, that we are members of that one
body, the universal man; and that what is done by each is done
for all.&nbsp; If individuals, therefore, are compelled by stern
necessity to study a few branches, and live in faith as regards
the rest, yet the race, man, becomes thereby the universal
scholar, a source of strength and happiness which makes itself
felt even down to the remotest member of the social body.</p>
<p>More especially, do not neglect, while cultivating the
intellect, to improve the heart.&nbsp; This would, indeed, be
division of labour which is very much to be deprecated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With the heart man believeth unto
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Knowledge puffeth up, but love
edifieth.&rdquo;&nbsp; If knowledge is the great moving power
that ensures progress, Christian love, love which fulfilleth the
law, is the great source of political stability, social harmony,
restoration of soul.&nbsp; Therefore, in the eloquent words of
the Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, words which in connexion with
the present subject well deserve to be
quoted,&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Sursum
Corda</span>,&rsquo; <span class="smcap">Upward</span>, <span
class="smcap">Hearts</span>,&mdash;upward, above all paltry,
sordid, grovelling aims and desires: upward, to a level with the
dignity of your calling, the privileges and duties of your
station, the importance and arduousness of your work: upward, to
a fellowship with the wise and good of all ages and all nations:
upward to the Father of Lights, the Fountain of all Goodness: <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span><span
class="smcap">Lift up your Hearts</span>.&nbsp; And from the
inmost depth of many devoted wills there rises the clear
response, &lsquo;<span class="smcap">We lift them up unto the
Lord</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a></p>
<p>Finally, why should not the leading spirits among you,
seriously and prayerfully studying the causes of the rise and
fall of nations, band together in a holy alliance, under the
title of Young Wales, to promote among your countrymen the spirit
of true as opposed to false patriotism; namely, a strong passion
for <i>sound</i> knowledge with its elevating, building power, as
opposed to mere erudition on the one hand, and on the other, to a
complacent resting in ignorance with its heritage of national
decadence, and slight store of light and soul-culture laid by for
heaven?&nbsp; Such a movement as this, radiating from our chief
Collegiate Institution, would be an event, the value of which to
the cause of Welsh nationality, it would be difficult to estimate
in too high a strain.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
